VCS helps to devlopers to work together and maitain the complete history of their work.

Fuctinonality of VCS:

1. Allow developers to work simultenously
2. Doesnt allow overwriting each other changes
3. Maintain history of every change.

Types of VCS:

1. Centralized Version Control Sysytem
2. Distrubuted Version Control System.

1. Centralized Version Control Sysytem: Central server to store all files and enables team colllabarations.

Example: CVS,SVN,Clearcase,Perforce.

disadvantage:

1. Failure of centarl server(single point of failure) .i.e. if server goes down for an hours in that time no one can collabrate at all.
2. If the disk of cental server get corrupted and doent have proper back also then loose the entire history of the project.

2. Distrubuted Version Control System.: this clients not only check out the snapshot of the directory but they also fully mirror of the repository.

Example: GIT,Mercury

Advanatge:

1. If server goes dowen or disk failure happen then we can copied back to server to restore.
2. Git doesnt rely the server that's why we can perform many operation in offline(commit,view log, create branch, other operations)
3. Rerquire network when we publish and get the latest changes.
4. Free and Open source : Git released under GPL open source license 
5. Fast and small: It gives huge benifits interms of speed because of most of tthe operations performed locally.
6. Implicity backup: 
7. Security:
8. No need of powerfull hardware:
9. Easier branching:

what is the GIT:





Q&A:

1. How can we know if a branch is already merged on to master?

git branch --merged master --list branches merged into master
git branch --merged -- Lists branches merged into HEAD(current branch)
git branch --no-merged ---lists branchs that have not been merged

2. what is the purpose of git stash?
